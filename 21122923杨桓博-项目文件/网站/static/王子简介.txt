A sentimental education in the form of a herbarium: several voice-overs take turns commentating the journey of a young man who has come to study at a gardening school. The characters never speak as themselves, but nor are they pinned to the wall like taxidermy butterflies: they are overflowing with desires. Through hunters, a planter and a beekeeper, the countryside reclaims its status as a highly erogenous zone. Botany and sexuality flourish in concert in the new film by a great French rural filmmaker.
